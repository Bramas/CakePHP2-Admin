CakePHP2-Admin
==============

Admin Plugin comes with a backend interface for creating menus that can host your own models. It offers several tools for content managment and security.

The plugin also propose two defaults models (Pages and Posts) that can be installed at the begining (you can then modify it as you want since there are not in the core of the plugin)

The front-end is left to you, but admin can redirect slugged url to the right controller.
